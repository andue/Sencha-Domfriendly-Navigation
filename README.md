Sencha-Domfriendly-Navigation
=============================

version 0.1.0  
based on Sencha Touch 2.2.0b1

A problem of the navigation in Sencha is that it is not realy dom-friendly.  
So i have written this Navigation based on Sencha Touch 2.2, which removes old views from the DOM upon Navigation and recreates them on backtap.

Usage:
------

1. copy the MhNavigationView.js to "./ux/touch/"
2. load your the file in your "./app.js"

```javascript
    Ext.Loader.setPath({
    	'Ext': 'touch/src',
    	'Ext.ux.touch': 'ux/touch',
    	...
    });
```
3. create a NavigationView and extend from "Ext.ux.touch.MhNavigationView" instead of "Ext.navigation.View"
or use the "xtype: 'mhnavigationview" instead of "navigationview".

4. create some Views and give them an "alias" like "MyView1"

5. add Views to the Navigation like this.

```javascript
    this.getMyNavigation().push(
    	Ext.createByAlias(
    		'MyView',
    		{
    			myInitaloption1: 'foo',
    			myInitaloption1: 'bar',
    			...
    		}
    	)
    ); 
```
6. push more than one View to the Navigation

7. Look at the DOM, you will see only the active View is in DOM the rest is removed.

8. hit the "Back" button, the previous view will be recreated before the active view and the active view will pop

9. Enjoy!


Pro:
----

- your DOM will remove the previous views upon deeper navigation

Cons:
-----

- previous view doesn't save there scroll position or something else, cause they are new created
